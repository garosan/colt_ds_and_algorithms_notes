## Introduction

- Curriculum walkthrough
- What order should you watch in?
- How I'm running my code

## Big O Notation

Objectives:
- Understand the need for Big O Notation
- Describe what Big O Notation is
- Simplify Big O Expressions
- Define 'time complexity' and 'space complexity'
- Evaluate time complexity and space complexity of different algorithms using Big O Notation
- Describe what a logarithm is

## Timing Our Code

```javascript
// Slower solution
const addUpToSlower = (n) => {
  let total = 0;
  for (i = 0; i <= n; i++) {
    total += i;
  }

  return total;
};

// Faster solution
const addUpToFaster = (n) => (n * (n + 1)) / 2;
```

Which one is better? And what does 'better' even mean?

- Faster?
- Less memory-intensive?
- More readable?

Using `performance.now()` to time our code.

The problem with Time

- Different machines will record different times
- The *same* machine will record different times
- Speed measurements may not be precise enough for fast algorithms

If not time, then what? Let's count the number of simple operations the computer has to perform.

In addUpSlower it is about 5n + 2 operations, but we say it's *n operations*.

### Big O 

- f(n) could be linear (f(n) = n)
- f(n) could be quadratic (f(n) = n <sup>2</sup>)
- f(n) could be constant (f(n) = 1)
- f(n) could be something different

### Rules of thumb for simplifying Big O Notation

- Constants don't matter
- Smaller terms don't matter

### Big O Shorthands

1. Arithmetic operations are constant
2. Variable assignment is constant
3. Accessing elements in an array (by index) or object (by key) is constant
4. In a loop, the complexity is the length of the

### Space Complexity

**Auxiliary space complexity**: term used to refer to the space required by the algorithm, not including the space taken up by the inputs.

Unless otherwise noted, when we talk about space complexity, we'll be talking about auxiliary space complexity.

#### Space Complexity in JS

Rules of Thumb:

- Most primitives (booleans, numbers, `undefined, null` are constant space)
- Strings require O(*n*) space (where *n* is the string length)
- Reference types (arrays, objects) are generally O(*n*)

### Logarithms

Most common Big O complexities:

- O(n<sup>2</sup>)
- O(n log n)
- O(n)
- O(log n)
- O(1)

log<sub>2</sub>(8) = 3   -----> 2<sup>3</sup> = 8

log<sub>2</sub>(value) = exponent   -----> 2<sup>exponent</sup> = value

For our purposes, `log<sub>2</sub> === log`.

## 3. Analyzing Performance of Arrays and Objects

Objectives
- Understand how objects and arrays work, through the lens of Big O
- **Explain why adding elements to the beginning of an array is costly**
- Compare and contrast the runtime for arrays and objects, as well as built-in methods

 ### Big O of Objects

 Objects are a great choice when you don't need any ordering.

Insertion - O(1)
Removal - O(1)
Searching - O(n)
Access - O(1)

Methods:

Object.keys - O(n)
Object.values - O(n)
Object.entries - O(n)
hasOwnProperty - O(1)

### Big O of Arrays

When to use arrays

- When you need order
- When you need fast access / insertion (kind of)

Insertion - Depends<sup>1</sup>
Removal - Depends
Searching - O(n)
Access - O(1)

<sup>1</sup>When we insert or remove from the beginning of the array, we need to recalculate all the indices, so it's O(n).

So `push()` and `pop()` are always faster than `shift()` and `unshift()`.

Big O of Array Operations

push - O(1)
pop - O(1)
shift - O(n)
unshift - O(n)
concat - O(n)
slice - O(n)
splice - O(n)
sort - O(n log n)
forEach / map / filter / reduce, etc.  - O(n)

## 4. Problem Solving Approach

Objectives

- Define what an algorithm is
- Devise a plan to solve algorithms
- Compare and contrast problem solving patterns including frequency counters, two pointer problems and divide and conquer


What is an algorithm? 

A set of steps to accomplish a certain task.

How to improve?

- Devise a plan for solving problems
- Master common problem solving patterns

### Problem Solving 'Algorithm'

- Understand the problem
- Explore concrete examples
- Break it down into smaller pieces
- Solve or Simplify
- Look back and refactor

Based on this [book](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/How_to_Solve_It)

## 5. Problem Solving Patterns

### Intro to Problem Solving Patterns

Some patterns:

- Frequency Counter
- Multiple Pointers
- Sliding Window
- Divide and Conquer
- Dynamic Programming
- Greedy Algorithms
- Backtracking

### Frequency Counter Pattern

- Uses objects or sets to collect values/frequencies of values
- Can avoid the need for nested loops or O(n<sup>2</sup>) operations

**Example:** Write a function called **same**, which accepts two arrays.
The function should return true if every value in the array has it's corresponding value squared in the second array. The frequency of values must be the same.

	same([1,2,3], [4,1,9])		// true
	same([1,2,3], [1,9])			// false
	same([1,2,1], [4,1,4])		// false (must be the same frequency)


Naive approach:

```javascript
const same = (arr1, arr2) => {
	if(arr1.length !== arr2.length) {
	return false;
	}
	for(let i = 0; i < arr1.length; i++){
		let correctIndex = arr2.indexOf(arr1[i] ** 2)
		if(correctIndex === -1){
		return false;
		}
		arr2.splice(correctIndex, 1)
	}
	return true
}
```
